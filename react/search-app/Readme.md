# Book Search App

This is a basic book search application, but it needs some help.

Things to work on:

- Star favorite books to pin them to the top
- Don't scroll the search away
- add some more book details inline (see a raw API sample: http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=the+lord+of+the+rings)
- open up more details about a book when you click
- strongly type the book type (at least partially for the used fields)
- Enter to search
- Auto-search when you type
- clean up the code (compontentize, separate out files)
- improve the overall styling
- display a loader

and any additional ideas you have, show us your creativity
